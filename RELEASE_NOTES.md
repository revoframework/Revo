# RELEASE NOTES

## [1.20.2] - 2020-02-12

### Fixed
- JobRunner was causing AmbiguousMatchException when a job handler class implemented more IJobHandler interfaces

## [1.20.1] - 2020-12-19

### Fixed
- missing IQueryTranslationPlugin in EF Core's internal DI container

## [1.20.0] - 2020-12-19

### Added
- custom query provider + helpers in EF Core provider for easier query authorization (default enabled by EnableCustomQueryProvider) with AuthorizationQueryableExtensions

## [1.19.0] - 2020-12-06

### Change

- catching ReflectionTypeLoadException exceptions in TypeExplorer

## [1.16.0] - 2020-06-23

### Added
- improved multi-tenancy configuration
- major refactoring of command bus internals:
  - support for multiple command buses (local, remote...)

  - overhauled command pipeline based on new and more flexible command bus middlewares
  - CommandExecutionOptions that can change the tenant context to run the command in and other options

- Permission now contains only PermissionTypeId instead of PermissionType
- Repository can now be instantiated even without any active UnitOfWork
- updated to (ASP).NET Core 3.1
- ASP.NET Core provider's RevoStartup class now only calls AddMvcCore() instead of AddMvc(), you have to add other parts yourself in ConfigureServices(...) if you want them

### Removed
- Revo.AspNetCore.Security.ISignInManager removed, use IUserContext instead
- AuthorizePermissionsAttribute for old ASP.NET 4 removed (inconsistent with the rest of the framework)

## [1.15.0] - 2020-03-05

### Added
- IDatabaseMigrationExecutionOptions.MigrateOnlySpecifiedModules can now be specified using wildcards

### Fixed

### Added
- event upgrade support - just implement IEventUpgrade in your code (auto discovery) and Revo upgrades the event streams on-the-fly upon loading the aggregates

### Fixed
- event version parsed from types whose name ends with V letter without number no longer recognized as versioned name

### Changed
- EventSourcedAggregateRoot.Commit increases Version by 1 (previously by event count)

- support for SQLite in EF Core infrastructure implementation (event store, async event queues, etc.)

### Fixed
- events are now correctly marked as dispatched even when there are no listeners for them
- fixed missing IExternalEventStore registration for EF6 provider
- not resetting DbContexts after EFCoreCoordinatedTransaction finishes

### Changed

- Revo.Extensions.Notifications and Revo.Extensions.History now need to be explicitly registered in Revo configuration using AddHistoryExtension and AddNotificationsExtension
- removed IRepository.SaveChangesAsync to avoid confusion - it doesn't work well in certain situations (e.g. with EF Core provider) and IUnitOfWork.CommitAsync should be used instead

- ReadModelForEntityAttribute no longer overrides mapped table name (leaves default)

### Removed

## [1.5.0] - 2019-01-10

### Added
- automatic event projector discovery and registration (now enabled by default)

- coordinated UoW transaction for EF Core including synchronous projections, publishing events from projections and fast event queue dispatching
- EFCoreInMemoryCrudRepository and EFCoreInMemoryDatabaseAccess
- recurring job scheduling support

### Fixed
- optimized event queue dispatching for big amounts of queues

## [1.4.0] - 2018-11-05

### Added
- [#1](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/issues/1) **ASP.NET Core support** - platform implementation, i.e. user context, security, DI, OData, etc.
- [#2](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/issues/2), [#3](https://github.com/revoframework/Revo/issues/3) **EF Core support** - data access & infrastructure (async events, sagas, projections...)
- Throttling async event processing to minimize the amount of running tasks and open DB connections (when running event queue catch-ups during app start-up and pseudo-synchronously processing events after a request; see IAsyncEventPipelineConfiguration)

### Changed
- **flattened and simplified package structure** (now provider-centric) - vendor-specific modules were moved
to Providers directory and some of them were merged/renamed:  
  - _Revo.Platforms.AspNet → Revo.AspNet_
  - _Revo.DataAccess.EF6 and Revo.Infrastructure.EF6 → Revo.EF6_  
  - _Revo.DataAccess.RavenDB → Revo.RavenDB_  
  - _Revo.Integrations.Rebus → Revo.Rebus_
- **improved AsyncEventWorker concurrency** - framework did not prevent multiple workers from parallel processing of one async event queue, causing occasional (e.g. when under heavy load) concurrency exceptions 
(which are eventually handled by an automatic retry); now allowing only one active worker per a queue in an application instance
- **Ninject binding extensions InRequestOrJobScope** is now two separate methods with corresponding fallbacks in order - InTaskScope (mostly preferred) and InRequestScope
  
### Removed
- **IAutoMapperDefinition** - removed as obsolete and replaced with AutoMapper's own profiles (auto-discovered again)
- **removed implicit ASP.NET Web API configuration** - i.e. default OData and serializer settings
- **TokenValidator** - removed as obsolete
- **(Tenant)ContextSequence** - removed (possibly to be reimplemented later)

### Fixed
- **CRUD repositories** now correctly wrap their **concurrency exceptions as OptimisticConcurrencyException**
- **objects from DI container** are now deterministically disposed at the end of tasks run within a context (also reducing amount of unused open DB connection)
- **Hangfire job task context disposal** now correctly awaits the command to finish

## [1.3.0] - 2018-08-31
### Fixed
- **EF6SagaMetadataRepository** bug not including the keys in a query
- **EF6 saga keys** not being reloaded correctly due to JSON serialization changing dictionary key character cases
- **ExecuteCommandJob** is now resolved correctly by Hangfire

### Added
- **(I)UserPermissionAuthorizer** for manual and more fine-grained user action authorization
- **EF6/EntityEventProjector** for more arbitrary projections

### Changed
- framework configuration - framework and its module parameters now need to be programmatically configured and set-up using the newly introduced **RevoConfiguration**
- **PermissionAuthorizer** renamed to PermissionAuthorizationMatcher
- **Default ASP.NET Web API JSON ContractResolver** switched to DefaultContractResolver with CamelCaseNamingStrategy from CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver
(matches default ASP.NET Core behavior and does not change dictionary key character cases)
- Hangfire integration for background job processing got its own **Revo.Infrastructure.Hangfire** package

## [1.2.0] - 2018-07-16
- First public version released.
